                I can code in languages like Python, JavaScript, Dart, Rust, and more. I like to think 
                I can easily get started with most languages (given documentation is available).

        Hello. This is a marquee. Nobody uses marquees anymore. It probably makes my static website feel weird because there's a single moving component.
        Free snout trousers at the link following: Joke's on you, there's no link here. I knew you would want a free pair of snout trousers, you fuck. 
        Nothing for you here. Sorry. You'll have to wallow in it. I'm not sure what exactly you wanted me to do about that. Anyway, I realize this marquee is
        in the footer. Probably because I put it there. What kind of footer is this? You were probably expecting a regular footer, but all of the links I care 
        to show you are on the rest of the webpage. It's small enough that you can just read the boring monospaced text and find it. It isn't that big of a deal.
        Speaking of a big deal, what's the deal with airline food? Better yet, what's the deal with that joke? It's like the magnum opus of bad joke references. It
        insists upon itself. The joke is that the joke is overused, but the joke itself doesn't even really mean anything. I don't know what I'm saying anymore. I'm 
        currently listening to Are We Ready (Wreck) by Two Door Cinema Club while typing this marquee. If you managed to get to the end of this you're officially a total
        loser and should probably get a life or something. In the case that you used inspect element to get to the end of this, you're an even bigger loser because that's
        cheating and there's no fun in cheating. Fuck you.
